# PWC_Internship 

#The first task in this internship is to analyse the dataset provided and build classification model.
#The dataset contains features which can detect if the customer will subscribe to the product that the bank agent advised over the phone or not.
#On analysing it can be found that the target variable has more counts of 'No' compared to 'Yes' . It is imbalanced in the ratio of 90:10%.


#Insights drawn from scatter plot

##nr.employed has positive relation with emp.var rate, cons price idx, cons conf idx,
##eurobor has non-linear relation with emp.var rate, nr.employed. cons price & cons conf has same pattern observed( non linear relationship )
##consconf has similar non linear relation with emp.var rate & cons.conf.non linear relation with euribor & nr. employed
#consprice has linear (positive) with emp var rate, negative linear relationship with cons conf. non linear with nr.employed & eurobor
##emp var has positive linear with consprice & nr employes.Negative relationship with consconf.non linear with euribor
##duration & campaign follows similar pattern with all other variables(non linear)
##pdays follows similar non linear relationship with all other variables
